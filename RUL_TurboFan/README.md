## Remaining useful life estimation for NASA Turbo Fan
This repo contains the notebooks on the NASA turbofan degradation dataset. The turbofan dataset consists of 4 separate challenges of increasing difficulty. The engines operate normally in the beginning but develop a fault over time. For each challenge, the engines in the train set are run to failure. The timeseries in the test set end 'sometime' before failure. The goal is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of each turbofan engine in the test set. 
I have only attempted to predict the RUL for the first data set, the details of which are explained below.
